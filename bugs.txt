One of the things I would like to have a look at soon is the dynamic arrays. 

I got a bit carried away with getting one working, and then went a bit nuts with copy and paste.

They are pretty rudimentary in approach (that was done for a reason to get a handle on how you might roll your own dynamic array, and learn some stuff).


The actual scanner itself is fairly relaxed about what it scans, and when it encounters syntax not in LOX it doesn't spit the dummy.

For example, the scanner itself will happily chew through actual Delphi pas files and spit out tokens for it.
