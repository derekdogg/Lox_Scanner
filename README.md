By the way, if you want to get involved feel free to do so. I know there's probably loads of things which need attention, tweaking or improving. Happy to collab. 

Anything is very much appreciated, tips, tricks, problems, whatever. Give it a nudge.

At this point, basic functionality of expressions seems to be OK. 

I'm not sure what chapter I'm currently on at the moment in crafting interpreters, (values, I think) but we (ahem) will need to add in other functionality soon (Hash tables anyone?) and or just improve 
existing code-base.

Unit tests would be cool. It's already a legacy code-base as nothing is unit tested.
